# Console-Based-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python
This project is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game in Python for the command line. Players take turns to enter moves on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for valid input, preventing overwrites, and updates the board in real-time. It also detects wins or draws after each move.
